Scroll down to the very bottom. Starting line 162 

First one (index.php?option=com_users&view=registration&layout=complete) is executed after user registration if account has to be activated by an administrator
Second (index.php?option=com_users&view=registration&layout=complete), if account has to be activated by user
Third (index.php?option=com_users&view=login), if account activation is not required.

Replace links depending on type of registration you use with FULL URL of your redirection page and you are done.
For example, if user activation on my website is not required and I want to redirect users after registration to http://www.mywebsite.com/welcome-reg the updated code will be:

$this->setRedirect(JRoute::_('http://www.mywebsite.com/welcome-reg', false));
